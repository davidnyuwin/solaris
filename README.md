# Hermes Companion ☄️

An elegant, open-source macOS native control surface and diagnostic panel for **Hermes Agent**. Inspired by native macOS assistant designs, it provides soft glassmorphism, responsive diagnostic visualizations, and low-latency interaction cards to control your local workflows.

## 🎨 Visual Design & Inspiration

Hermes Companion is built as a **desktop control panel** rather than a generic chat shell:
- **Abstract Ambient Orb**: A glowing, breathing SwiftUI canvas visualizing the current Hermes state (*listening, processing, speaking, or error*).
- **Glassmorphic Sidebar**: Translucent macOS native material listing active hosts, connections, and health configurations.
- **Structured Cards**: Distinct responsive tiles displaying provider latency metrics, parsed error logs, and execution summaries.
- **Capsule Command Bar**: Quick bottom command bar with micro-actions and attachment slots.

## ⚙️ Architecture

The app is structured strictly around **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** and uses Swift concurrency (`async/await`) and service protocols.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- macOS 14.0 or newer.
- Xcode 15.0+ or command-line Swift toolchain.

### Build and Run with Terminal
To clone and run immediately from your macOS shell:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/solaris.git
cd solaris

# Compile and run the app
swift run
```

### Run Tests
If your local toolchain is connected to a full Xcode app bundle, you can execute standard unit tests:
```bash
swift test
```

## 🔌 Connection Map: Real API Integration

The app relies on the `HermesService` protocol definition. To wire in your actual local server:

1. Replace `MockHermesService()` instantiation in `MainView.swift` with a production service:
```swift
struct LiveHermesService: HermesService {
    let endpoint: URL
    
    func getStatus() async throws -> HermesStatus {
        let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: endpoint.appendingPathComponent("/status"))
        return try JSONDecoder().decode(HermesStatus.self, from: data)
    }
    // ... implement recent runs, logs, and sendCommand via SSE or REST
}
```
2. Configure your custom endpoint under **Settings** view in-app.

## 🗺️ Roadmap
- [ ] Connect Live local daemon via WebSocket / Server-Sent Events (SSE).
- [ ] Add active system telemetry graphs for token-per-second counters.
- [ ] Implement local database backup for runs timeline.
- [ ] Build global floating hotkey HUD (Command + Shift + H) to wake up the orb.
